//! The one thread that touches the queue's files.
//!
//! `Queue::append` takes the queue's lock as its first act, so every append is
//! serialized whichever thread runs it. Handing each one to the blocking pool
//! therefore bought no parallelism at all, and cost a thread per concurrent
//! export -- tokio will spawn up to 512 of them. Under glibc a thread that
//! allocates is given an arena of its own, and an arena keeps whatever it grew
//! to: `docs/MEMORY.md` measured that term at three quarters of the footprint
//! by taking it away with `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1`.
//!
//! So the appends went to one thread that owns the queue, which is what the
//! lock already made them. Everything else the queue does to a file has now
//! followed them here: closing a segment and `fsync`ing it, opening and
//! mapping one to send, and unlinking the ones signy has answered for. None of
//! those is asynchronous -- an `fsync` is a syscall that returns when the
//! device says so -- and every one of them used to run on a tokio worker,
//! where a stall is not one task waiting but every task on that worker
//! waiting. That is survivable with a worker per core and it is not survivable
//! with one.
//!
//! What this costs is that a segment read now queues behind whatever the
//! thread is already doing, where the blocking pool would have run it beside
//! an append. Appends and seals were already serial with each other through
//! the queue's lock, so the reads are the new thing, and `SpoolReport` is here
//! to say how long anything waited.
