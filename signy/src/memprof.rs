//! Which part of the engine the resident bytes belong to.
//!
//! `docs/VISION.md` invariant I divides a declared budget into arenas, and the
//! shares it proposes were written before anything measured them. M10 phase A
//! is the measurement, and this is its instrument: a global allocator that
//! tags every allocation with the arena that was current when it was made, so
//! **live** bytes — not merely allocated bytes — can be attributed. Peak
//! anonymous memory is what an OOM kill is decided on, and cumulative
//! allocation says nothing about it.
//!
//! Off unless the `memprof` feature is on. With the feature off, [`enter`] is
//! an inlined function returning a zero-sized value and the process keeps the
//! system allocator, so a release build is unchanged. With it on, every
//! allocation grows by `max(align, 16)` bytes to carry its tag, which is
//! itself reported (`live_allocations`) so a reader can subtract it.
//!
//! The label is a thread-local, so a guard must never be held across an
//! `.await`: a suspended task leaves its label on a worker thread that then
//! runs somebody else's future. Every call site here wraps a synchronous
//! region — the `spawn_blocking` closures the flush, merge and query paths
//! already run inside, and the straight-line decode in the push handler.
//! Attribution is therefore precise where a guard exists and lands in
//! [`Arena::Other`] where none does, which is a reported bucket rather than a
//! silent one.
