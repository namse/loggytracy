//! The two phases the comparison needs that a load run cannot give it.
//!
//! A paced load run sends whatever it managed to send, at wall-clock
//! timestamps. Two runs of it against two systems therefore produce two
//! *different* datasets, and any row-level comparison between them would be
//! comparing arrival timing rather than engines. So the query comparison runs
//! on its own dataset:
//!
//! * **`seed`** pushes a fixed corpus at fixed log timestamps, driven from an
//!   anchor both runs are given. Same seed, same rows, same bytes, same
//!   timestamps — the two systems provably hold the same entries.
//! * **`matrix`** times the four query shapes over that dataset, cold and
//!   warm, and records a digest of every answer so the two runs can be checked
//!   for returning the same response — every row, the labels each row carried,
//!   and where the response put them. A fast wrong answer is not a win, so the
//!   digest is the part of this file that matters most.
//!
//! Neither phase paces, and neither reports a throughput. They are latency and
//! correctness instruments; the rate axis belongs to `Phase::Load`.
