//! The metric query matrix: the fn0 shapes, timed cold and warm, with the
//! per-answer records the agreement check runs on (M14, issue #8).
//!
//! The same discipline as the log matrix in `matrix.rs`, with one structural
//! difference the float domain forces. Log answers are compared by digest
//! alone, because two engines that agree return byte-comparable rows. Metric
//! answers come in **two declared classes**:
//!
//! * **exact** — raw samples and sum/count aggregations of them. Both engines
//!   return the floats the corpus stored (or sums of a few dozen of them), so
//!   the answers are compared on a digest of every value rounded to nine
//!   significant digits — far finer than any difference that would matter,
//!   coarse enough that summation order cannot flip it in the ordinary case.
//! * **tolerance** — `rate` and quantiles, where each engine's window
//!   arithmetic is its own (the rate definitions agree by decision, the
//!   floating-point path does not have to), so a digest equality would
//!   manufacture disagreement. Every answer therefore carries its full record
//!   set, and the report compares the two sides pointwise under
//!   `|a - b| <= max(1e-9, 0.005 * |b|)`, withholding the shape's ratios when
//!   the comparison fails — the same rule the log bed applies to a digest
//!   mismatch.
//!
//! The shapes are frozen *before* the engine exists to answer them — the
//! signy paths below are the read surface Phase 7 must implement, not a
//! description of one that runs today. That order is the point: the ruler is
//! built first, and the engine grows to fit it rather than the reverse.
