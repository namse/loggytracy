//! glibc allocator tuning, applied before the runtime spawns a thread.
//!
//! `docs/MEMORY_ATTRIBUTION.md` measured the gap this closes: at the OOM the
//! kernel decided on, 44–69% of the cgroup's anonymous memory was
//! already-freed heap glibc had not returned, and the `trimmed` variant —
//! `MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=1` with a fixed 128 KiB trim threshold — took anon/live
//! from 2.5–4.1 down to 1.34 on the same workload. Setting it here instead of
//! asking every operator to export two environment variables makes the
//! measured configuration the default one.
//!
//! This must run before any other thread exists: an arena is created the
//! first time a thread contends for one, and `M_ARENA_MAX` only bounds the
//! arenas not yet created. `main` calls this before building the tokio
//! runtime.
//!
//! `LOGGYTRACY_MALLOC_TUNING=off` restores glibc's defaults — the knob an
//! A/B measurement or an unexpected throughput regression reaches for.

/// Few arenas: freed memory consolidates where `M_TRIM_THRESHOLD` can
/// actually return it. One arena was measured first and rejected: anon fell
/// 3.6× but the flush path — allocation-heavy by design — halved its cadence
/// contending with the query and ingest threads for the single arena, and
/// the steady WAL backlog rose 8 → 50 MiB. The default is the measured
