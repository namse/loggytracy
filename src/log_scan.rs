//! Lifted out of `query/execution.rs` because nothing under `benches/` could
//! reach it there. The shape [`docs/COMPARISON.md`](../docs/COMPARISON.md)
//! measured this engine losing on — `| json | field=` with a small limit over a
//! window far larger than the limit — is a property of the *executor* rather
//! than of any single part scan, so it was the one hot path with no bench.
//! `benches/query.rs` measures this module.
//!
//! What it owns: the memtable and the parts are read through one funnel, in one
//! direction, with one limit, and the deletion mask is applied in one place.
//! `query/execution.rs` supplies the mask and the stats; everything else about
//! how a log query is answered is here.
