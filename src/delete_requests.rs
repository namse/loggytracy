//! The Loki delete API: a tenant asks for a selector and a time range to be
//! removed, and this decides what that means here.
//!
//! Two things have to be true and they have different costs. The data must stop
//! being readable, which has to happen now — a deletion request is usually
//! somebody exercising a right, and "it will disappear within the hour" is not
//! an answer. And the bytes must actually go, which cannot happen now, because
//! parts are immutable and rewriting one to drop a few rows is the most
//! expensive operation this engine has.
//!
//! So a request does both, at the speed each can go. Every read path funnels
//! through one scan, and that scan drops the matching rows from the moment the
//! request is accepted. The bytes leave when the parts holding them are next
//! rewritten, which merge and retention already do, using the same per-row
//! predicate. `status` reports which of the two has happened.
//!
//! Not offered: Loki's cancellation grace period, where a request sits
//! unapplied for 24 hours so it can be withdrawn. Hiding immediately and
//! allowing the request to be withdrawn until the rewrite lands is the same
//! affordance without a window in which the data is still being served.
