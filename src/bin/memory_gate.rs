//! The gate for [`docs/VISION.md`] invariant I: at a declared memory budget,
//! under sustained mixed load, does the engine survive — and does the *cgroup's*
//! anonymous footprint stay under the number the operator declared?
//!
//! **It measures `anon` out of the cgroup's `memory.stat`, and nothing else.**
//! `docs/MEMORY_ATTRIBUTION.md` is the reason: at the instant the kernel killed
//! this engine at a 2 GiB limit, its own live-byte accounting read 669 MiB and
//! `loggytracy_memtable_bytes` read 111 MB, because 44 % of the anonymous
//! footprint was memory the process had already freed. A budget validated
//! against the engine's own view of itself would have reported headroom at the
//! moment of death. The cgroup's `memory.peak` is no better in the other
//! direction: it includes the page cache this engine's own Parquet writes
//! create, so it says the limit was touched by data that was reclaimable.
//! `anon` is what an OOM kill is decided on. Both are recorded; only `anon` is
//! gated.
//!
//! **Why a binary rather than a `#[test]`.** It needs a cgroup scope, a real
//! server process and minutes of wall clock, so it cannot be an ordinary unit
//! test; `cargo test` stays a second long. It is not a shell script either,
//! because `docs/LOAD_RESULTS.md`'s retirement is what happens when a
//! measurement lives in a script and a document and drifts away from the code:
//! the verdict here is typed, it compiles under the same
//! `clippy --all-targets -D warnings` gate as the engine, and there is no
//! second copy of it in `awk`. It is one command with one machine-readable
//! answer:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release --bin memory_gate -- --budget 2GiB
//! ```
//!
//! **Four outcomes, four exit codes**, because "it failed" is not a finding:
//!
//! | exit | verdict | means |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 0 | `UNDER_BUDGET` | survived, delivered the workload, peak `anon` ≤ budget |
//! | 2 | `OVER_BUDGET` | survived, but peak `anon` exceeded the budget |
//! | 3 | `OOM_KILLED` | the kernel killed it inside its own declared budget |
//! | 4 | `NOT_MEASURED` | the measurement did not happen |
//!
//! `NOT_MEASURED` is a failure, never a skip: `docs/LOAD_RESULTS.md` §3 records
//! a peak RSS that had never been measured being written down as an engine
//! result, and the rule it arrived at is that **a gate that cannot measure must
//! not pass.** So a missing cgroup, a limit that did not apply, a server that
//! never became ready, a server that crashed for reasons other than the OOM
//! killer, zero samples, or a workload the engine refused most of, are all
//! failures with a stated reason rather than a green light.
//!
//! `OVER_BUDGET` is only reachable when `--limit` is larger than `--budget`.
//! With the two equal — an operator's case, and the default — the kernel
//! enforces the ceiling before `anon` can cross it, so the honest answer at a
//! budget this engine cannot hold is `OOM_KILLED`. Raising `--limit` above
//! `--budget` is how the overshoot is *measured* rather than merely fatal, and
//! it is how the baseline in `docs/MEMORY_BUDGET_GATE.md` was found.
//!
//! **Not in CI.** It needs a cgroup v2 scope, a systemd user manager and
//! minutes per run, and the number it produces is worthless on a shared runner
//! whose neighbours are invisible. CI compiles it — `clippy --all-targets` and
//! `cargo test` both build this target — so it cannot rot, and running it
//! anywhere without a usable cgroup exits 4 rather than passing.
//!
//! `LOGGYTRACY_MEMORY_BUDGET` exists now (2026-08-08), and the two numbers
//! meet by construction rather than by being repeated: this gate creates the
//! cgroup scope at `--limit`, and the server inside detects that same scope's
//! `memory.max` and declares 60% of it as its budget, deriving its ceilings
//! from that. `--server-env LOGGYTRACY_MEMORY_BUDGET=...` still overrides for
//! an A/B, and `--server-env LOGGYTRACY_MEMORY_BUDGET=off` measures the
//! pre-budget behaviour.

usage: memory_gate --budget <size> [options]

  --budget <size>        the declared budget peak cgroup `anon` is compared
                         against (required), e.g. 2GiB, 3584MiB, 8G
  --limit <size>         the cgroup's memory.max. Defaults to --budget, which is
                         what an operator does. A larger limit makes an overshoot
                         measurable (OVER_BUDGET) instead of fatal (OOM_KILLED).
  --name <name>          run name, used for the output directory and the scope
                         unit (default: budget)
  --out <dir>            output directory (default: target/memory_gate/<name>)
  --seconds <n>          duration cap for the workload (default: 240)
  --events <n>           events to ingest before stopping (default: 1200000)
  --eps <n>              offered ingest rate (default: 20000)
  --connections <n>      ingest connections (default: 8)
  --query-eps <n>        query rate; must be > 0 (default: 5)
  --query-connections <n> query connections, separate from ingest (default: 4)
  --settle <n>           seconds to keep sampling after the workload stops, so
                         the merge backlog load leaves behind is inside the peak
                         (default: 150, the comparison bed's settle). 0 measures
                         only the peak of accepting load, which is what this
                         gate did before it was found to miss a kill.
  --scenario <what>      logs (default) drives the paced mixed log load; metrics
                         drives the M14 churn phases — steady, rolling series
                         replacement, then a cardinality burst — and gates
                         acceptance on the steady phase alone, because the
                         later phases refuse new series by design
  --seed <n>             corpus seed (default: 1592598566, the comparison bed's)
  --port <n>             server HTTP port (default: 3251)
  --server-env K=V       extra environment for the server, repeatable
  --skip-build           do not run cargo build first
  --keep-data            keep the server's data directory

exit codes: 0 under budget, 2 over budget, 3 OOM-killed, 4 not measured,
64 usage. Anything other than 0 is a failure.
