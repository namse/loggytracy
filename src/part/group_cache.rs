/// The per-admitted-group constant the rare shapes pay is the wide reader's
/// build — dictionary pages and column-chunk setup for every projected
/// column, priced at ~1.5 ms per group even when the selection keeps four
/// rows. A part is immutable, so rows decoded once can serve every later
/// scan; the cache holds exactly what a completed decode already produced
/// (`RecordBatch` clones are `Arc` refcounts — filling costs no second
/// decode), and it dies with its `PartReader`, which is dropped on
/// unregister and replace — no invalidation code at all.
///
/// Entries are keyed by `(row group, selection)`, not by row group alone,
/// because the comparison bed's queries — and Grafana's — are sub-windows:
/// the time page selection almost never keeps a whole group, so a
/// whole-group-only cache never fills. A decode that ran its selection to
/// completion is cached under that selection; a later scan producing the
/// same selection (a repeated window, or a different predicate resolving to
/// the same rows — `metadata_rare` after `json_field_rare`) replays the
/// batches without touching Parquet. The full-group selection is one key
/// among these, and the only one general enough to also serve *other*
/// selections by slicing and the narrow pass by direct evaluation.
///
/// The budget is one process-wide byte counter shared by every reader
/// (`LayoutTotals`' shape). A reader that pushes the total past the budget
/// evicts its own least-recently-used entries first; strict global LRU
/// across readers is deliberately not built — eviction here only decides
