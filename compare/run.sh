# The one-command reproduction of docs/COMPARISON.md.
#
#     compare/run.sh
#
# Everything it does is in this file, in order, and every knob is a default
# rather than an assignment so a caller can vary one without editing anything
# (the rule scripts/run_load_local.sh was fixed to follow in M8).
#
# Three targets, one script. The first three-way numbers were produced by an
# ad-hoc shell loop that bypassed this file — and with it the agreement check,
# which is how a timing table went out over answers nobody had compared. The
# fix is structural: there is no per-target code path here to fork, only the
# TARGETS list, so a run that includes a system includes its checks.
#
# The shape of the run, and why it is this shape:
#
#   1. Fresh volumes, all containers up at the same memory limit.
#   2. **Ingest**, one target at a time. Sequential rather than concurrent, so
#      no system's throughput is a function of what the others were doing on
#      the same twelve cores. All are stopped at the same *event target*, so
#      all end up holding the same number of entries — a run capped on time
#      would let a faster system hold more data and then be measured querying
#      it.
#   3. **Seed**, the fixed verification dataset, identical bytes at identical
#      timestamps on every side. This is what the query numbers and the
#      row-equality check are taken over; see src/bin/load/matrix.rs.
#   4. **Settle**, equally: Loki is told to flush (its chunks otherwise sit in
#      the ingester for up to `max_chunk_age`, two hours, and a disk number
#      taken before that is not a disk number), VictoriaLogs is told to flush
#      its in-memory parts (rows are not searchable before that flush — three
#      whole runs once returned zero VictoriaLogs rows because a loop queried
#      immediately after seeding), then everything is left alone for
#      SETTLE_SECONDS so flush, merge and compaction can run. Disk and the
#      ingest memory peak are read here.
#   5. **Restart all**, so "cold" in the query matrix means a process that has
#      just started rather than one whose caches the seeding filled.
#   6. **Matrix**, one target at a time, six shapes, cold then warm.
#   7. Read the query-phase memory peak and disk again, then generate the
#      document from the JSON.
